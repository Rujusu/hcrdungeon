A small stall run by [[Faronfall/Faronfalla/NPCs/Anthony Mapstore\|Anthony Mapstore]] located by the entrance to the "[[The Dungeon/Level 1/1. Entarance\|Dungeon]]".
#### Appearance
Anthony's stall is a compact but inviting setup, crafted from sturdy wooden planks and draped with weathered, colorful fabrics. Maps of various sizes are prominently displayed, some fluttering gently in the breeze while others are neatly pinned to a wooden backdrop. The stall is adorned with a mix of practical adventuring gear, including compasses, lanterns, and coils of rope, all meticulously organized for easy access. A hand-painted sign reads "Anthony Mapstore's Cartography & Supplies," adding a personal touch to the bustling little market spot.

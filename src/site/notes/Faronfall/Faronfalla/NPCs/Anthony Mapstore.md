##### Notes
Anthony operates mainly by The Dungeon, trying to sell both old and new maps. However, most of these maps are fake, created to swindle inexperienced adventurers. He uses his charm and quick wit to persuade buyers, often preying on their hopes of discovering hidden treasures. Despite his dubious business practices, he is well-liked for his engaging personality and entertaining stories. Adventurers who catch on to his schemes often find his stall a good place to gather information or gossip about the latest happenings in town.

### Bleed

A creature affected by Bleed takes 1d4 necrotic damage at the start of their turn for each level of Bleed they have. This damage cannot be reduced in anyway. The Bleed effect can be stopped by a successful DC (10 + current Bleed level) Medicine check. The check is made at advantage if a healer’s kit is used. This effect can stack up to 10 levels of Bleed.

At this level you take 10d4 necrotic damage and the DC is 20.

Unless otherwise stated, all these effects end with a long rest or a _Lesser Restoration_ spell.
### Dazed

An affected creature has their movement speed halved and can only perform an action or a bonus action, not both. They cannot make reactions. Regardless of the number of attacks they can normally make, they can only perform one attack.

All Intelligence, Wisdom and Charisma checks and saving throws are made at disadvantage for the duration of the condition.

Unless otherwise stated, all these effects end with a long rest or a _Lesser Restoration_ spell.
### Disoriented
Your mental clarity and force of personality have been significantly impaired, leaving you less capable of performing mental tasks and casting spells. Stupefied always includes a value.

***Status Penalty.*** You take a penalty equal to your stupefied value on Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma saves and Intelligence-, Wisdom-, and Charisma-based ability checks.

***Spellcasting Penalty.*** You take a penalty equal to your stupefied value on spell attack rolls and your spell save DC for Intelligence-, Wisdom-, and Charisma-based spells.

***Spell Fizzle.*** Any time you attempt to cast a spell while stupefied, the spell fizzles unless you succeed at a flat check with a DC equal to 5 + your stupefied value + spell level.

***Recovery.*** After a long rest, your stupefied value decreases by 1.
### Diseased

All physical checks and saving throws are made at disadvantage. Each stack of Diseased imposes a -1 penalty to any physical attack rolls. At the end of each long rest, the creature must make a DC (10 + current Diseased level) Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, they gain a level of exhaustion, one more stack of Diseased and do not remove ant stacks of exhaustion.

On a successful save, remove the Diseased condition.

Unless otherwise stated, all these effects end with a long rest or a _Lesser Restoration_ spell.
### Cripple

A creature affected by Cripple has their movement speed reduced by 5 feet. This effect can stack but can never reduce the creature’s movement speed to less than 5 feet.

Unless otherwise stated, all these effects end with a long rest or a _Lesser Restoration_ spell.
### Hindered
Your agility and reflexes have been diminished, making you slower and less coordinated. Hindered always includes a value.

***Status Penalty.*** You take a penalty equal to your hindered value on Dexterity saves and Dexterity-based ability checks. You AC is also lowered by the same amount.

***Ranged Attack and Damage Loss.*** You take a penalty equal to your hindered value on ranged attack rolls and damage rolls.

***Recovery.*** After a long rest, your hindered value decreases by 1.
### Panic

Panic sets in if a creature is under the frightend condition for 2 or more turns. Starting on their 3rd turn under fear, they most make a Wisdom saving throw with a DC (10 + number of rounds under the fear condition). On a failed save, they lose control of their actions. There is a 50% chance they will either run away from their fear or run towards it.

If they are within 5 feet of any creature at the end of their movment, they must also make a melee attack against it.

Unless otherwise stated, all these effects end with a long rest or a _Lesser Restoration_ spell.
### Weakened
Your physical strength has been sapped, leaving you feeble and less capable in combat and other strength-based activities. Weakened always includes a value.

***Status Penalty.*** You take a penalty equal to your weakened value on Strength saves and Strength-based ability checks.

***Melee Attack and Damage Loss.*** You take a penalty equal to your weakened value on melee attack rolls and damage rolls.

***Recovery.*** After a long rest, your weakened value decreases by 1.
### Withered

Your health and vitality have been depleted as you've lost blood, life force, or some other essence. Withered always includes a value.

***Status Penalty.*** You take a penalty equal to your withered value on Constitution saves.

***Hit Point Loss.*** You lose a number of Hit Points equal to your level (minimum 1) times the withered value, and your maximum Hit Points are reduced by the same amount. For example, if you become withered 3 and you're a 3rd-level character, you lose 9 Hit Points and reduce your maximum Hit Points by 9. Losing these Hit Points doesn't count as taking damage.

***Recovery.***
After a long rest, your withered value decreases by 1. This increases your maximum Hit Points, but you don't immediately recover the lost Hit Points.

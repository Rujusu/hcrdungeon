#### Overview

The resting system has been modified to add new dynamics and challenges to the game. Players now have several options for resting, each with unique benefits and limitations. The goal is to create a balance between maintaining party health and resources while managing the risks associated with resting in The Dungeon.

#### Types of Rests

1. **Quick Bolster**
    
    - **Duration**: 10 minutes
    - **Benefits**:
        - Players can use half of their hit dice (rounded down) to regain hit points.
        - Hit dice used do not count as expended.
        - Can regain only up to half of their maximum hit points.
    - **Drawbacks**:
        - Every other Quick Bolster after the first one in the same day adds one level of **Withered**.
    - **Explanation**: 
	    - Quick Bolster is a short, 10-minute rest allowing players to recover a portion of their hit points without expending hit dice. However, the use is limited to avoid excessive recovery in a single day, adding a level of **Withered** if used more than once.
1. **Short Rest**
    
    - **Duration**: 1 hour
    - **Benefits**:
        - Functions as a standard short rest, allowing the use of hit dice to regain hit points.
    - **Requirements**:
        - At the start of the rest, roll on the Dungeon Table to determine if an encounter or event interrupts the rest.
        - To regain hit points, a player must use one charge of a healer's kit.
    - **Explanation**: 
	    - A Short Rest lasts an hour and allows players to use their hit dice to recover hit points. This rest requires a charge from a healer's kit, emphasising resource management and preparation.
3. **Long Rest**
    
    - **Duration**: 8 hours
    - **Conditions**: Must be done in a designated "safe zone" within The Dungeon.
    - **Benefits**:
        - Players roll half of their maximum hit dice (rounded down), which do not count as expended.
        - Regain hit points equal to the amount rolled plus Constitution modifier for each die. Can reroll 1s and 2s but must use the second result.
        - Players regain a number of class abilities or spell slots equal to their character level, chosen strategically. This pertains only to abilities regained on a long rest.
    - **Examples**:
        - A level 3 wizard can choose to regain 1 level 2 spell slot and 1 level 1 spell slot, or 3 level 1 spell slots, or the use of Arcane Recovery and 2 level 1 spell slots.
    - **Drawbacks**:
        - Does not restore full hit points or all class abilities.
    - **Explanation**: 
	    - A Long Rest, lasting 8 hours, allows players to recover hit points and some class abilities or spell slots. Players roll half of their maximum hit dice and regain hit points plus Constitution modifiers, with the option to reroll 1s and 2s. This rest does not fully restore hit points or all class abilities, reflecting the challenges of resting in the wilderness.
4. **Full Rest**
    
    - **Duration**: 2 days in town
    -  **Conditions**: Must be taken in a settlement.
    - **Benefits**:
        - Fully restores hit points.
		- Restores half of maximum Hit Dice.
		- Restores all class abilities.
    
    - **Explanation**: 
	    - A Full Rest, taken in a settlement over 2 days, allows for complete recovery. Players fully restore their hit points, regain half of their maximum hit dice, and all class abilities. This rest simulates the safety and comfort of a secure environment, offering comprehensive recovery.

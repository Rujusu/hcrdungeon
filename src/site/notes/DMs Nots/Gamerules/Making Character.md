## Starting Equipment and Gold
Instead of starting with the standard adventurer's pack, roll 2d6 + 3 to determine the amount of additional gold you receive. Add this to any gold provided by your background.

You can use this gold to purchase any equipment from the Player's Handbook, except for the standard adventurer's pack.

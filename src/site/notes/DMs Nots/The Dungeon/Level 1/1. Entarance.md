##### The keep
---
*As your party approaches the entrance to "The Dungeon," the atmosphere grows palpably tense. The path you traverse is flanked by dense, ancient forest, the trees gnarled and twisted, their leaves rustling softly as if whispering secrets of the perilous journey ahead. The canopy above is so thick that only slivers of sunlight penetrate, casting long, eerie shadows on the forest floor.*

*Emerging from the tree line, you behold a sight that both awes and unnerves. Before you stands a colossal, ruined keep, its once-mighty walls now crumbling under the weight of centuries. Moss and ivy cling stubbornly to the weathered stone, softening its harsh lines but adding an air of melancholic decay. At the base of a towering mountain, this ancient fortress looms over you, its imposing silhouette framed against the dusky sky.*

*The entrance to The Dungeon is an immense archway, wide enough for ten men to walk abreast. Intricately carved runes, glowing faintly with a ghostly blue light, adorn the archway, their meanings lost to time but their power unmistakable. These ancient symbols pulse softly, casting an eerie luminescence that flickers like dying embers. The massive wooden doors, now ajar, hang on rusted hinges, their once-grand carvings barely discernible under layers of grime and rot.*

*As you step closer, the air grows noticeably colder, sending shivers down your spine despite the warm evening. Strange, echoing noises emanate from within the keep — a distant roar, faint whispers, the clinking of metal on stone — creating a cacophony that hints at both danger and the promise of untold treasures. The ground beneath your feet is uneven, littered with fallen stones, brittle bones, and fragments of ancient relics, each a testament to the many who have ventured here before you.*

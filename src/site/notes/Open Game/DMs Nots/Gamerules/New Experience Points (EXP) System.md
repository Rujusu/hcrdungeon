#### Overview

In this Dungeons & Dragons session, players will gain experience points (EXP) through two primary methods: defeating monsters and retrieving loot from The Dungeon. This new system emphasizes the importance of both combat and exploration, encouraging players to balance their strategies for maximum gain. Additionally, EXP is only granted once the party successfully returns to the town, adding an element of risk and reward.

#### Experience Points from Killing Monsters

- **Reduced EXP from Monsters**:
    - Each monster defeated will provide only half of the normal EXP.
    - This reduced EXP will then be divided among all party members equally.
    - Example: If a monster normally grants 200 EXP, it will now grant 100 EXP, which will be split among the party. In a party of four, each member would receive 25 EXP.

#### Experience Points from Loot

- **EXP from Loot**:
    - Any item or coin brought out of The Dungeon will provide EXP based on its monetary value.
    - The conversion rate is 1 gold coin = 1 EXP.
    - For items, their value in gold pieces (gp) will determine the EXP granted.
    - Example: An item worth 50 gp will grant 50 EXP, which will be divided among the party. In a party of four, each member would receive 12.5 EXP.

#### Return to Town Requirement

- **EXP is Granted Upon Return to Town**:
    - Experience points from both killing monsters and retrieving loot are only granted when the party successfully returns to the town.
    - This adds an element of risk, as players must survive the journey back to the town with their loot and earned EXP.

#### Detailed Examples

1. **Defeating a Monster**:
    
    - A monster normally grants 400 EXP.
    - Under the new rule, it grants 200 EXP.
    - In a party of four adventurers, each receives 50 EXP upon returning to town.
2. **Loot Retrieval**:
    
    - The party finds 100 gp and an item worth 40 gp.
    - Total loot value: 140 gp, which translates to 140 EXP.
    - Divided among four party members, each receives 35 EXP upon returning to town.

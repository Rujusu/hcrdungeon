Faronfalla is a bustling town situated at the edge of a mysterious and foreboding mega dungeon, simply known as "The Dungeon." Approximately 300 years ago, the dungeon appeared without warning, unleashing a horde of monsters upon the surrounding lands. In response, the lord of the land hired mercenaries to combat them and push them back.

Eventually these mercenaries formed the Hunters Guild. Now a revered institution where individuals register as adventurers. These adventurers brave the dungeon's depths to combat the monstrous threats, unearth valuable treasures, and seek the ultimate prize promised by legend: their heart's desire.

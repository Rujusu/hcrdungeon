## Foraging for Ingredients Rule Set

Characters can forage for ingredients in the wild using skill checks. This rule set provides guidelines on how to determine the success of foraging attempts, the quantity of ingredients found, and the environmental factors that influence foraging difficulty.

#### Skill Checks

Characters can make skill checks to forage for ingredients. The appropriate skills include:

- **Wisdom (Survival):** General foraging.
- **Intelligence (Nature):** Identifying edible plants.
- **Wisdom (Perception):** Spotting ingredients.

**Set DCs:** Based on the abundance and difficulty of finding ingredients in the environment. Adjust the DCs for different environments as follows:

#### Environment-Based DC Adjustments


| Environment | DC    |
| ----------- | ----- |
| Forest      | - 1   |
| Desert      | +5    |
| Dungeon     | +3    |
| Underdark   | +2    |
| Arctic      | +4    |
| Coastal     | +1    |
| Grassland   | +/- 0 |
| Mountain    | +2    |
| Swamp       | +1    |
| Urban       | +2    |


#### Foraging Time

Foraging takes time. A typical foraging attempt might take 1-2 hours. The DM decides how much time passes and what encounters might occur during this period.

#### Gathering Results

Based on the skill check result, determine the quantity and quality of ingredients found. Use the table below to determine results:

|**Skill Check Result**|**Ingredients Found**|
|---|---|
|DC 1-5|-|
|DC 6-9|Enough for 1 meal|
|DC 10-12|Enough for 2 meals|
|DC 13-14|Enough for 3 meals|
|DC 15-19|Enough for 4 meals|
|DC 20+|Enough for 6 meals|

### Example Foraging Process

**1. Identify the Environment:**

- The characters are in a forest, so the DC is set to normal (e.g., DC 10 for a lush forest).

**2. Skill Check:**

- Each character makes a skill check using either Wisdom (Survival), Intelligence (Nature), or Wisdom (Perception).

A small stall run by [[Published/NPCs/Anthony Mapstore\|Anthony Mapstore]] located by the entrance to the "[[DMs Nots/The Dungeon/Level 1/1. Entarance\|Dungeon]]".
#### Appearance
Anthony's stall is a compact but inviting setup, crafted from sturdy wooden planks and draped with weathered, colourful fabrics. Maps of various sizes are prominently displayed, some fluttering gently in the breeze while others are neatly pinned to a wooden backdrop.  A hand-painted sign reads "Anthony Mapstore's Cartography & Magical Supplies," adding a personal touch to the bustling little market spot.

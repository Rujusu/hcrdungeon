## Crafting Overview
Crafting an item requires a base amount of material. For mundane items (from the PHB), the cost of materials is one-fourth of its price in the PHB (unless otherwise stated).

***Example:** Crafting a longsword costs 4 gp in base materials (15/4 = 3.75, rounded to 4 gp).*

Crafting an item also requires time, and one cannot spend more than 8 hours a day on manufacturing.

***Example:** Crafting a longsword takes 16 hours to complete, meaning it will take 2 workdays (16 hours / 8 hours per day = 2 workdays).*

If the item needs a special ingredient or material, this will be listed in its recipe.

## Abilities & Tools
Crafting an item requires ability checks and the appropriate tool proficiency. Some tools or items might offer a choice of which ability to use for the check.

***Example:** Crafting a longsword requires a Strength check using smithâ€™s tools.*

If someone attempts to craft an item without the necessary tool proficiency, the DC is increased by 5, and the checks are made with disadvantage.

#### Notes:
- **Primary Ability**: This is the ability score most commonly used with the tool. Depending on the task, the DM might decide another ability score is more appropriate.
- **Smith's Tools**: These can use Strength for tasks involving physical forging, and Constitution for endurance over long crafting periods.
- **Cook's Utensils**: Wisdom is used to reflect the skill and knowledge required in cooking.
- **Tinker's Tools**: Intelligence is used for creating and understanding mechanical devices.
- **Some tools may have flexible primary abilities depending on the task.** For example, a DM may allow Intelligence for complex smithing designs instead of Strength.

## Difficulty Checks
For mundane equipment, the DC follows this rule:

### Weapons
- **Simple:** DC 10
- **Martial:** DC 13
- **Additional Properties:** +1 to the DC per property

***Example:** A longsword is a martial weapon (DC 13). It has one property (versatile), increasing the DC by 1 to a total of DC 14 (13 + 1).*

### Armor
- **Light:** DC 10
- **Medium:** DC 12
- **Heavy:** DC 14
- **Shields:** DC 10
- **Additional Armor Value:** Add the armor value over 10 to the DC

***Example:** A breastplate is medium armor (DC 12). Its added armor value over 10 is 4 (14 - 10). So the DC is 16 (12 + 4).*

### Items
- **Adventuring Gear:** Any gear under 10 gp in the PHB has a flat DC of 10.

## Crafting Process
1. **Gathering Materials and Tools:** Ensure all necessary materials and tools are gathered before starting the crafting process.
2. **Time Allocation:**
    - If the item takes 8 hours or less to craft, the work must be done in one continuous session.
    - For items that take more than 8 hours, the work can be spread out over multiple days. These workdays do not need to be consecutive.
3. **DC Check:** The ability check to determine the success of the crafting is performed at the end of the entire process.
#### **Crafting Tables**

|Item Type|Base DC|Material Cost|Time Required|
|---|---|---|---|
|Simple Weapon|10|1/4 price|8 hours|
|Martial Weapon|13|1/4 price|16 hours|
|Light Armor|10|1/4 price|16 hours|
|Medium Armor|12|1/4 price|32 hours|
|Heavy Armor|14|1/4 price|64 hours|
|Shield|10|1/4 price|8 hours|
|Adventuring Gear|10|1/4 price|Varies by item|
***Time may vary with items***
## Unique Traits
When crafting mundane or magical items, the outcome can vary based on the crafting roll.

- **13 or less:** Destroyed
- **-12 to -9:** 1 major flaw, 1 minor flaw
- **-8 to -5:** 2 minor flaws
- **-4 to -1:** 1 minor flaw
- **0 to 4:** Standard
- **5 to 8:** 1 minor boon
- **9 to 12:** 2 minor boons
- **13+:** 1 major boon, 1 minor boon

***Example:** If you are making a long sword and roll a 10 on your check (DC 14), your long sword will gain 1 minor flaw (10 - 14 = -4, meaning you missed your check by -4). If you instead rolled a 19 on your check, your long sword gains 1 minor boon (19 - 14 = 5, meaning you exceeded your check by 5). Ignore any duplicate results on flaws or boon tables and roll again.*

### Minor Flaws
